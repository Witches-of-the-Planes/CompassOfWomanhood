    <h1>Compass Of Womanhood (COW) mod for BG2:EE</h1>

    <p>
    "Compass of Womanhood" (COW), subtitled "Ways of Women, Ways of Pleasure", is a mod project for Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition.
    </p>

    <p>
    Its goal is to create diverse cast of interesting female companions that fit well with both the Forgotten Realms lore and the base games. All the mod's components are, by design, dual-language — in most cases both the English and the Polish version can be considered "the original" (it's usually bolded when that isn't the case).
    </p>
    
    <h2>List of companions</h2>

    There are currently two companions developed as a part of this project, but additional companions may be added to the list:
    <ul>

Worshipper of orcish goddess <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Luthic">Luthic</a>, Mother of Caves. She's free-spirited and loves a good drink (and is quite persistent with her offers of drinking). Speaks in heavy pirate accent (pirate dialect even, in Polish language version).
        <br><br>
        This component includes:
        <ul>
          <li>One chaotic-neutral half-orc swashbuckler</li>

          <li>Lots of orc, liquor and naval lore</li>
          <li>(Polish version only) a dedicated "pirate dialect"</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Shithri is found in the Docs District of Athkatla, near the lighthouse ([3564.3086]).
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
