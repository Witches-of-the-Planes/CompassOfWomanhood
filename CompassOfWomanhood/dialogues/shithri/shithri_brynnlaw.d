// Some pirates at Vulgar Monkey should react to Shithri

// Implementation Note:
// Pirate Bill tells a pirate joke - if Shithri's in the party,
// she can guess the answer to his "riddle".
//
// Problem being: some language versions (e.g. Polish) have the joke
// mistranslated:
//
// The original riddle: "Aye, mate, bend yer ear fer a secon'... Whaddaya call a fish wit' no eyes?"
// Answer would be: "Fsh". Like "fish" but with no "i" (eye).
//
// Polish version (aside from not sounding any "piratey") is translated literally though,
// while that joke doesn't work in Polish. Weird, considering the next string contains the answer,
// but maybe the translator still didn't get it or simply had no idea how to translate it.
//
// Because it doesn't seem probable for another mod to modify this particular
// character's state 0, this one will "fix" the joke by assigning it a new
// string that will be translated so that the joke holds.
//
// It's implemented simply by appending a state with weight.
//
// Note: yeah, could use a variable to use the original string for English
// and some other for Polish or something, but that's a compatibility nightmare
// for a relatively minor advantage of not including the original text here.
