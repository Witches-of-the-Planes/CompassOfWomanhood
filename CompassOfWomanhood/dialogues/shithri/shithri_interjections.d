// Normally, the dialogue options are allowed depending on a character's gender
// plus an eager answer may be disallowed for some. Neera is the only canon
// companions who is conditionally eager: she is eager but only if the romance
// with her isn't active.
//
// As a side note: it's interesting how Nalia is eligible here for
// an exotic massage, but not when talking with Madam Nin. Looks like she draws
// the line at sexual stuff.
//
// Considering the above, Shithri may be added for "eager" path as long as she's
// not in a romance with Neera + Neera should get an additional condition. Because
// state 1 of Shithri-Neera romance is less serious than in canon romances, the "eager"
// path can probably be permissed for state 1.

// IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
//
// In this situation, only one companion may speak,
// with the following priority order:
// 1.  Imoen
// 2.  Jaheira
// 3.  Viconia
// 4.  Anomen
// 5.  Minsc
// 6.  Cernd
// 7.  Haer'Dalis
// 8.  Mazzy
// 9.  Nalia
// 10. Jan
// 11. Korgan
// 12. Keldorn
// 13. Valygar
// 14. Edwin
// (Note the lack of EE characters, surprisingly)
//
// It seems to be the order in which they will "run" to you, putting
// the closest, most loyal and supportive friends (Imoen, Jaheira) first
// and the least emotionally concerned (Korgan), most distant (Edwin)
// or simply silent (Valygar) - last.
//
// Therefore Shithri cannot "outrun" Imoen and Jaheira - she's nowhere
// as important of a person to the PC and vice versa. Some mods do add
// such a person, e.g. Tashia mod seems to put Tashia between Imoen and
// Jaheira - which, at least in case of romance, seems fair, Tashia
// being quite an expressive person and being in quite a close relationship
// to the PC. Shithri, however, is more of a buddy-buddy-bud person
// and not that eager to express genuine care. She's also not romancable
// by the PC. That would put her somewhere in the Cernd-Haer'Dalis-Jan category.
//
// That category also suits well because Shithri:
// * would respect that Imoen is PC's sister, ergo: family, and therefore
//   is more important than herself
// * wouldn't consider herself more important than Jaheira due to her respect
//   for sha'nru
// * could just want to avoid drama with Viconia and Anomen as it's
//   not a good moment for drama
// * would always let Minsc first because he's her good friend
// * would consider whatever Cernd has to say more important than what
//   she wants to say
// Aside from Aerie, that all fits very well for placing her right after Cernd.
// Whenever she would let Haer'Dalis first or not is debatable,
// but considering how calm his reaction is - she should probably come first.
//
// That settles Shithri as being placed between Cernd and Haer'Dalis.
//
// Compatibility with other mods is more challenging here, as it's rather
// challenging to take every possible scenario in the account
// for a situation like this. Here is the implementation that seems
// good enough for the author (Udiknedormin) of this script:
//  1. Add Shithri's reaction at the bottom, so that it's checked first.
//  2. Add the negative triggers for all the characters "above" her on the list.
//     That way her reply won't be picked over them, but will be picked over
//     any others.
//  3. In case Tashia or a similar mod is installed after Shithri - works fine,
//     as Tashia mod adds an explicit ~!IsValidForPartyDialog("Tashia")~ trigger
//     to other transitions.
//  4. In case Tashia or a similar mod is installed before Shithri -
//     add their respective characters here. It should still work fine if those
//     aren't installed.

// For other EE companions - no reason really. Even though Shithri likes Neera,
// Neera doesn't seem to react quickly here, so it seems to make sense to take

// Similarly to Slayer "feeling" and "change", although the order is,

// 1.  (EE) Neera
// 2.  (EE) Hexxat

// 15. Cernd

// 17. Jan
// 18. Mazzy
// 19. Haer'Dalis
//
// Considering how Shithri has no reason not to go before Keldorn,
// that's her position in this ordering.
//
// In the previous two situations Dorn was prioritized over her,
// so in this one she will have her chance to speak. Seems fitting
// to the original design of reordering the characters.
